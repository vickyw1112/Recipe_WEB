1. each recipe can have mutiple tags so the relationship is many to many
    Recipe <--  HasTag --> RecipeTag
2. each ingredient can have mutiple category, many to many
    eg. egg can be in both dairy category and baking category
    Ingredient<--  InCategory --> Category
    this may need change according to our dataset
3. the relationship between user and recipe is many to many on bookmark
    User <--  Bookmark --> Recipe
4. the relationship between user and recipe on ownership is one to many
5. many to many
 Recipe <--  UseIngredient --> Ingredient


design choice:
1. There are two ways to implement an one to one relationship. First way is use 2 tables and
the second way is add the second table into the first one as a field. The difference is if the 
most of the field in second table can be null, it saved storage space rather than combine into one table
where you have a lot of null field.



Question:
1. do one ingredient have mutiple category in our dataset?
